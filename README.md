Welcome! This repository contains a collection of C++ projects.
I built to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming, efficient memory handling, and clean design principles.

Projects Included


1.Vector Operations Program

A console-based application demonstrating dynamic vector manipulation using:

-> Efficient menu-driven interface with switch cases.

-> Const references to avoid unnecessary copying and enhance performance.

-> User-friendly functions to add, display, and analyze elements in a vector.

2. Movie Library Program

This program simulates a simple movie management system where you can:

-> Add movies with associated ratings and watch counts.

-> Increment the watch count for each movie.

->Prevent duplicate entries and validate movie data.

->Practice class creation, validation, and object management


3. Banking System

A comprehensive simulation of a banking environment demonstrating advanced OOP concepts:

Account Types:

-> Savings_Account: Allows deposits with interest accumulation.

-> Checking_Account: Charges a fee per transaction.

-> Trust_Account: Limits to 3 withdrawals (each â‰¤ 20% of balance), provides deposit bonuses.

Object-Oriented Features:

-> Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

-> Printable Interface to overload the print method for each account type.


Exception Handling:

-> InsufficientFunds and IllegalBalance exceptions ensure safe and valid transactions.


Account Handler Class:

-> Manages all account-related operations like deposit, withdraw, and printing details in a structured manner
