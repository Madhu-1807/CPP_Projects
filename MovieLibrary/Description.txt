This program is a foundation for movie fanatics to keep track of what movies they have watched and how 
many times they watched each movie

The program supports the following:

class Movie - models a movie which includes
- movie name
- movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
- watched - the number of times the movie has been watched

class Movies - models a collection of movie objects

Obviously, Movies needs to know about Movie since it is a collection of Movie object
However, our main driver should only interact with the Movies class.

The main will be able to
- create a Movies object
- ask the Movies object to add a movie by providing the movie name, rating and watched count
- ask the Movies object to increment the watched count by 1 for a movie given its name
- ask the Movies object to display all of its movies


Additionally, 
- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the movies collection 
we should display this error to the user
- if we try to increment the watched count for a movie whose name is not in the movies
collection we should display this error to the user
